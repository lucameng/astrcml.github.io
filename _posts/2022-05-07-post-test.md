## Let's get started!  

I'm gonna post things in ASTROWORLD from now on.  
It can be some interesting things just happend, or it can be some technical stuff which is hard as fuck[^1]. Also I might be sharing some hit songs and albums in here.  
If you are interested in it, store it up and check out from time to time.  

## Navigation

 Click that **menu** and navigate to everywhere in **ASTROWORLD**!
