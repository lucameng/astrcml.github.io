`ASTROWORLD` is an alias I'd like to name my PLACE, presented by who I am.
`Astrc`, derived from `Astro`, which can also be considered as a nickname. If you know `Jacques Webster`, aka `Travis Scott`and also `La Flame` in Franch, one of the most famous rapper in the world, then you know what it is.
`Astro` is one of the `Ad-Libs`[^1] created by `Travis Scott`. La Flame also came out with a hit album `ASTROWORLD`on August 3,2018.
Do an ad-lib anytime you want! For me it'll be like "ASTRO!!!".
