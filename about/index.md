## Astrc

`Astrc`, derived from `Astro`, which can also be considered as a nickname. If you know `Jacques Webster`, aka `Travis Scott`and also `La Flame` in Franch, one of the most famous rappers and artists in the world, then you know what it is.

`Astro` is one of the `Ad-Libs`[^1] created by Travis Scott. La Flame also came out with a hit album `ASTROWORLD`on August 3,2018.
Do an ad-lib anytime you want! For me it'll be like "ASTRO!!!".
