`Astrc`, derived from `Astro`, is just a alias I'd like to name stuff of mine, which can also be considered as a nickname. If you know `Jacques Webster`, aka `Travis Scott`and also `La Flame` in Franch, one of the most famous rapper in the world, then you know what it is.
`Astro` is one of the `Ad-Libs`[^1] created by `Travis Scott`. La Flame also came out with a hit album `ASTROWORLD`on August 3, 2018.
Do an ad-lib anytime you want! For me it'll be like "ASTRO!!!".
