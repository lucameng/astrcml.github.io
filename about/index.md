## Astrc

`Astrc`, derived from `Astro`, can be also considered as a nickname. If you know `Jacques Webster`, aka `Travis Scott`and also `La Flame` in Franch, one of the most famous rappers and artists in the world, then you know what it is.

`Astro` is one of the `Ad-Libs`[^1] created by Travis Scott. He also has another one, 'Straight up!'. Rappers always have `ad-libs` in there hip-hop music. It can be `Yeah`, `Oh`, or the most famous one, `Skrrrrrrr~` 

La Flame also came out with a hit album `ASTROWORLD`on August 3, 2018. That's how ASTROWORLD comes.

Do an ad-lib anytime you want! For me it'll be like "ASTRO!!!".
