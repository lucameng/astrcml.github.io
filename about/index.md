`Astrc`, derived from `Astro`, which can also be considered as a nickname. If you know `Jacques Webster`, aka `Travis Scott`and also `La Flame` in Franch, one of the most famous rappers and artists in the world, then you know what it is.

`Astro` is one of the `Ad-Libs`[^1] created by Travis Scott. La Flame also came out with a hit album `ASTROWORLD`on August 3,2018.
Do an ad-lib anytime you want! For me it'll be like "ASTRO!!!".

## About ASTROWORLD:  

`ASTROWORLD` is an alias I'd like to name my PLACE, presented by who I am.  
* **contents**: most of my posts are for technology learning, etc. It can also be my another Moment.
